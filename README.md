Back in 0.21 days [Jarcikon](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/79734-jarcikon/) made a little plugin that display the (real) time in KSP, I asked and he let me take over his work, so here is the new version : **Real Time Clock 2**. 


The clock is visible in the KSC view, the VAB, the SPH, the Tracking Station, in flight and, if you own the Making History DLC, in the Mission Builder.

You can drag wherever you want, its position is saved per scene.

In the settings menu you can choose and which scene it should be active and if you want to use 24h format or am/pm.
